# README.md Template 2022

test

## Description
- A developers GitLab profile is an extremely important aspect of their public identity as a professional web developer. A well-crafted profile allows one to show off their work to potential employers. An important component of a GitLab profile that is overlooked by many new developers is the README.md file. 
- The quality of a README often differentiates a good project from a bad project. A good one takes advantage of the opportunity to explain and showcase what the application does, justify the technologies used, and discuss challenges faced and features that may be implemented in the future. A good README allows one to stand out amongst a sea of developers displaying their own work on GitLab. 
- A good README should include a title and a short description explaining the what, why, and how. What was the project motivation? Why did you build this project? What problem does it solve? What did you learn? What makes your project stand out?
